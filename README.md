# The Story
I used to rely on printed guitar chord sheets for quite a while until I had a realization:
we're living in the 21st century, after all!  
Instead of carrying around a tiny ring binder filled with carefully chosen song pages in my guitar case, 
only to struggle with them on a windy day outside, 
I discovered a simpler solution. I decided to switch to using a screen!  
Initially, I considered using an e-reader, 
but later realized that a tablet screen would be even more convenient due to its responsiveness.
