# The Story
I had been using printed guitar chord sheets for a few years when I realized that this is the 21st century.  
Instead of stuffing a small ring binder of selected few hand-crafted song pages into my guitar case,
only to later deal with a windy situation outside,
I can simply use a screen!  
I started out the project with e-reader in mind,
then later figured out a tablet screen will be better because of responsiveness.
